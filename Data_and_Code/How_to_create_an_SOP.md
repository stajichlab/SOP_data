# You've accomplished something through bioinformatics, but you want to share it to your friends/labmates. 

But how can you create a Github Markdown file to contribute to the SOP pile?

Orient yourself to the `stajichlab` github profile.

Look for the `SOP_data` repository and open up the `Data_and_Code` Repository.

You're in!

Now to create your file look to the right icon and click on `Add file`, this will start an empty writing pad.

See if you can add a title to your document. Make sure to end the title with a .md!

Ex. `How_to_create_an_SOP.md`

Github knows how to automatically convert this document to a markdown. 

Hardest part is done! If you want to add and configure your document to be more interactive look through this webpage. (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)


Good luck!
